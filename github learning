1.I think when people do coding, they always start with somehing they already have and make changes using other codes they used before, this will save tons of time of typing. Revision history is needed, then we can see what we correct about the program, also we may face other trouble later, codes have limit cause there are so many way to accomplish one goal, but when we need the code to accompish tem goals, it maybe not working, then we go back to what we have and figure another way out.
